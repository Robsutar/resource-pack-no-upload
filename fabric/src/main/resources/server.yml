  type: Delayed
  # Delay in ticks to send the resource pack for the player at their server join.
  sendingDelay: 1

  # Delay in ticks to resend the resource pack if had no response.
  # NOTE: for proxies, in older minecraft version, the resending is not that well performed, in those cases, a higher
  # sendingDelay is preferred.
